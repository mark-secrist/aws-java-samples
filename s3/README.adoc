= Sample overview

Code samples to illustrate the use of the S3 SDK

== Key learnings

* There is a general pattern of creating a *Request object and returning a *Result object
* You must be cautious about performing a task on an S3 bucket when the region
is set differently from the bucket region being operated on
* A new feature added in SDK 2.20.111 added a new method `crossRegionAccessEnabled()` that allows more
flexibility when dealing with buckets outside the configured region. This includes listBuckets
listBucketObjects, getObject,etc.
