= Sample overview

Code samples to illustrate the use of the S3 SDK.
This set of code has been built and tested using my AWS account.
Whatever account is used will require the following policies to be granted at
a minimum

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CustomS3Policies",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:DeleteBucket",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

== Key learnings

* There is a general pattern of creating a *Request object and returning a *Result object
* You must be cautious about performing a task on an S3 bucket when the region
is set differently from the bucket region being operated on
* A new feature added in SDK 2.20.111 added a new method `crossRegionAccessEnabled()` that allows more
flexibility when dealing with buckets outside the configured region. This includes listBuckets
listBucketObjects, getObject,etc.
